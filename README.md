yelp_prediction
===============
The idea is to predict the next possible location the user will visit. The dataset is taken from yelp dataset challenge available at http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge . Recommender systems have become a key tool for providing users with personalized recommendations on items such as movies, music, books, news and more. In today’s time, social influence plays an important role in product marketing or business. However, it has been rarely considered in traditional recommender systems. I have tried to use the approach where user’s social influence (friends and friends of friends) is taken into account along with the traditional user preferences and item’s general acceptance while predicting new locations. Refer the attached word documen for detailed information.
